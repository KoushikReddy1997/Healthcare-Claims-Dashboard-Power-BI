Introduction:

This project delves into Healthcare Claims analysis encompassing Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Enrollment data gathered for California's statewide Healthcare Payments Program.
  -The Medical data file comprises counts of medical procedures from medical claims and encounter data in HPD.
  -The Pharmacy data file contains counts of drug prescriptions from pharmacy claims and encounter data in HPD.
  -The Enrollment data file encompasses counts of claims and encounter data collected for California's statewide HPD.

Goal: The objective is to discern trends and variations in Healthcare claims data across different sectors spanning from 2018 to 2021.

Tools Used: Python, Excel, and Power BI were employed for this analysis.

Analysis Process:
  Data Cleaning & Visualization:
    -Uploaded CSV files into Python for initial data preparation.
    -Detected and handled duplicate values, replaced missing/null values, and standardized variable names.
    -Conducted thorough examination for multiple entries, semicolons, and outliers.
    -Ensured data integrity by rectifying data entry errors such as extra white spaces and standardizing string values.
    -Exported the cleaned dataset and imported it into Power BI for dashboard creation.

Results:
  -In the Medical data, Medicare payer type dominated over Medicaid & Commercial categories until 2020, but experienced a drastic decline in 2021.
  -Across all years, the "All" category appears to dominate claims types, followed by Pharma and Medical claims.
  -Based on enrollment records, the "All" category dominates in Claims type, Payer type, and Product type.
  -Notably, generic drug prescriptions significantly surpass branded drugs.

Conclusion:
  This analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of Healthcare claims data, particularly in California's healthcare landscape.
  By leveraging Python for initial data processing and Power BI for visualization, a comprehensive understanding of trends and patterns was achieved.
  These findings hold significance for stakeholders involved in healthcare policy-making and program management.
